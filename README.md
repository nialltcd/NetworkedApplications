Coursework project for the CS7009 module lectured by Dr. Stephen Barrett

This project utilizes:  
	- Haskell functional programming language  
	- GitHub api  
	- Node4j database  
	- Yesod - a Haskell web framework  

The project interacts with the GitHub api to crawl information regarding the repositories that a user owns.
An authentication token is used during this process.

An example of this crawled information being displayed can be seen in the Graphs folder.
